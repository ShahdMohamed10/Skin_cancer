# Skin Cancer Detection using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for skin cancer detection and classification. The model is trained to identify different types of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images.

## Dataset

The project uses the Skin Cancer Dataset from Kaggle:
[Skin Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farjanakabirsamanta/skin-cancer-dataset)

The dataset contains dermatoscopic images of various skin lesions, categorized into different types of skin cancer and benign conditions.
